## Install
clone the repo via git:
```
git clone https://github.com/status-im/murmur.git
```
And then install the dependencies with yarn.

$ cd murmur
$ npm install

## Run
```
./bin/murmur
```

Connection to murmur can be done via [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) using a `Web3.providers.WebsocketProvider` pointing `ws://localhost:8546`



It can also be used as a JS library, in conjunction with IPC, however this is  highly experimental and prone to errors at this stage.

```
import Murmur from 'murmur-client';
const murmur = new Murmur();
murmur.start();
```
