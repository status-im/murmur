Murmur
===

<p align="center">
A Whisper node / client implementation built in Javascript, with the goal of being a pure JS project able to run in the browser.

<strong>WIP. DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION. HIGH RISK âš </strong>

## Install
clone the repo via git:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/status-im/murmur.git
```
And then install the dependencies with `npm`.
```
$ cd murmur
$ npm install
```
## Run
```
$ ./bin/murmur
```

Connection to murmur can be done via [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) using a `Web3.providers.WebsocketProvider` pointing `ws://localhost:8546`



It can also be used as a JS library, in conjunction with IPC, however this is  highly experimental and prone to errors at this stage.

```
import Murmur from 'murmur-client';
const murmur = new Murmur();
murmur.start();
```

For reference on how to use, please check this [branch](https://github.com/status-im/status-js-desktop/tree/use_murmur) on `status-js-desktop` repository. This readme will be updated once we have a definite implementation for using `murmur` as a dependency of a JS project.
