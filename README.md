Murmur
===

<p align="center">
A Whisper node / client implementation built in Javascript, with the goal of being a pure JS project able to run in the browser.
</p>
<p align="center">
<strong>WIP. DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION. HIGH RISK âš </strong>
</p>
<br />



## Installation
To install Murmur for use in node or the browser with require('murmur-client'), run:
```
npm install murmur-client
```

To install Murmur as a command line program, run:
```
npm install -g murmur-client
```
Alternatively, you can use `yarn`.


## Usage

Murmur can work as a command line application, and as a web3 provider in both browsers and node.js applications:

### Command line application

To start a bridge between LIBP2P and DEVP2P:
```
$ murmur
```

To start a non-bridge DEVP2P client, with websocket support for connecting to whisper using [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/), with a `Web3.providers.WebsocketProvider` pointing `ws://localhost:8546`.
```
$ murmur --ws --no-libp2p --no-bridge
```

Full list of flags can be seen with `murmur -h`:
```
  -V, --version           output the version number
  --ws                    enable the websockets RPC server
  --config [path]         use configuration file. (default: provided config)
  --wsport [port]         websockets RPC port [default: 8546]
  --devp2p-port [port]    DEVP2P port [default: 30303]
  --libp2p-port [port]    LIBP2P port [default: 0]
  --no-devp2p             disable DEVP2P
  --no-libp2p             disable LIBP2P
  --no-bridge             disable bridge between LIBP2P and DEVP2P
  --signal-servers [url]  signal server address [i.e. /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/9090/ws/p2p-webrtc-star,...]
  -h, --help              output usage information
```

In the case of `--config`, if this flag is not specified, it will use the default configuration included in the package: `data/config.js`. See this file for structure and valid values accepted.


### Web3 provider (in browsers and node.js applications)
Murmur can also be used as a JS library, since it can act as a valid web3 provider:

```js
const Murmur = require('murmur-client');
const Web3 = require('web3');

const server = new Murmur({
  protocols: ["libp2p"],
  signalServers: ["/dns4/127.0.0.1/tcp/9090/ws/p2p-webrtc-star"],
  bootnodes: []
});

server.start();

server.onReady(async () => {
  const web3 = new Web3();
  web3.setProvider(server.provider);

  // Use web3.shh functions here
});

```

The `Murmur` object accepts an option array where protocols like `"libp2p"` and `"devp2p"` can be specified. It's recommended in the case of clients to only use a single protocol at a time. (It hasn't been tested yet with multiple protocols, since that functionality is intended for bridges). When using `"libp2p"`, the attribute `"signalServers"` is required, containing at least one signal server address. You can use the npm package [`js-libp2p-webrtc-star`](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p-webrtc-star#rendezvous-server-aka-signalling-server) implementation if you do not have a signal server.

This package will be updated to allow specifying bootnodes and static nodes for `"devp2p"`. Currently it will use those specified in the configuration included in the package: `data/config.js`
